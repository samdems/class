# Lesson Plan: Introduction to MicroPython with Spells

## Objective:
- Introduce basic programming concepts using MicroPython in a fun and engaging way.
- Familiarize students with simple programming "spells" using MicroPython functions.

## Materials:
- microcontrollers with MicroPython installed 
- Spellbook library (`spellbook.py`)
- Projector or whiteboard for demonstration

## Lesson Outline:

1. **Introduction (15 minutes):**
   - Welcome and introduce the concept of programming using magical spells.
   - Explain that we'll be using MicroPython to cast spells and make things happen.

2. **Setting the Scene (10 minutes):**
   - Discuss the idea of a "Spellbook" and how it contains magical spells (functions) that we can use.
   - Show the `spellbook.py` file and briefly explain the spells available.

3. **Exploring the Spells (30 minutes):**
   - Demonstrate each spell with a simple example.
     - `pause_for_a_while`: Introduce the concept of pausing and waiting.
     - `magical_light_on`: Turn on a magical light (simulated output).
     - `magical_light_off`: Turn off the magical light.
   - Encourage students to try out each spell on their own.

4. **Hands-On Activity (20 minutes):**
   - Provide a set of exercises for students to practice using the spells.
     - Make the magical light blink.
     - Combine spells to create a magical light show.

5. **Sharing and Reflection (10 minutes):**
   - Have students share their creations with the class.
   - Discuss what they learned and how they can use spells to control things with code.

6. **Conclusion and Homework (5 minutes):**
   - Wrap up the lesson by summarizing key points.
   - Assign a simple coding challenge or encourage students to practice casting spells at home.
